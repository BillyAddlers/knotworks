# NOTE: Welcome to Makefile, entry point for your Build Tools!
#
# This Makefile serves as a simple demonstration of how the build process works.
# In more complex projects, you'll want to encapsulate commands within this Makefile
# and utilize the `/scripts` directory to streamline your project's build and run operations.
#
# Be aware that some commands interact with `/tmp` directory.
# If your operating system does not support `/tmp`, lacks access to it,
# or requires a different path, please adjust the configuration accordingly.
# Remember to set `main_package_path` to your specific entry point.
# For example, `main_package_path = ./cmd/example` indicates that your entry point is located at `./cmd/example/main.go`.
main_package_path = .
binary_name = knotworks
